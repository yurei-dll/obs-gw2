# OBS-GW2

Designed to be displayed as a webpage widget for livestreams. The webpage tracks achievements using their IDs on the Gw2 API. You can get the achievement ID from the name by using `achievements.json` (but be warned: the file is over 184,000 lines). The IDs can then be put into the `ACHIEVEMENTS_TO_TRACK` array found on line 19. Next just give it an API key with the `progression` scope, and the script will take care of everything else.
